## Manufacturing Notes
All images of cases displayed in this repository are of prototypes manufactured through the CNC-machining services provided by [PCBWay](https://pcbway.com). They are my preferred way for quickly getting prototypes. A lower-cost (and lower quality) alternative would be [JLCPCB](https://jlcpcb.com). Their manufacturing capabilities are more limited, cases received from them have had noticeable machining marks even after bead-blasting. Conversely, the resin 3D-printing services from [JLCPCB](https://jlcpcb.com) are excellent and provided at very reasonable cost. Would highly recommend ordering resin prints to check dimensional correctness, and then proceeding with CNC-machining after verifying. Resin printing is also well-suited for buttons and power switch sliders pieces.
