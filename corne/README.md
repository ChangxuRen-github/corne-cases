1. 4 x SKUF Silicone Rubber Feet

All of the listed parts can be bought through Typeractive, except for the case components, female/male standoffs, battery, and SKUF feet. 

## Manufacturing Notes
1. You only need to print 1 x [buttonSlider.stl](buttonSlider.stl), however it is recommended that you print at least one extra to accomodate any mistakes in the post-processing of the printed pieces. One print of the STL includes 2 x power sliders and 2 x reset bumpers to be cut/snapped apart.
2. Recommended manufacturer for the case is [PCBWay](https://pcbway.com), manufacturer for the printed button/slider is [JLCPCB](https://jlcpcb.com).
3. Material used for [buttonSlider.stl](buttonSlider.stl) is SLA "Black Resin", bead-blasted polycarbonate for the case.

## Assembly
1. Assemble the keyboard sans-case as per the [documentation](https://docs.typeractive.xyz/build-guides/corne-wireless) on the Typeractive site.
2. Carefully screw female/male standoffs into each half of the case body. Be careful not to overtighten, and ensure it is perpendicular to the interior of the case!
3. Using flush cutters, separate the power slider and reset button extension from the 3D-printed part. 
4. Insert power slider and reset button extension into their respective slots in the case.
5. At an angle, slide the PCB/Plate assembly of the Corne into the case, ensuring the power switch and reset button on the PCB interface correctly with the slider/extension.
6. Bolt down PCB, apply switches and keycaps, flash as per the firmware [documentation](https://docs.typeractive.xyz/build-guides/corne-wireless)  on the Typeractive site.
